### Mock Reddit Client Project 

## Introduction

I made this small project following CodeCademy Full-Stack Engineer career path. 

It is my first practical project, especially using technologies such as React, Redux & utilites like React-router.

To clarify, there is no specific instructions about how to build this app on CodeCademy, only pointers on what are the big parts as shown below (similar to Trello or other project management tool).

## Steps 

Even though I haven't work professionnally as a dev yet, I tried to follow common good practices as much as I could. 

As such, I started by doing preliminary work :  a product backlog (which isn't really pretty I admit), some wireframes (my first ones ever) and in general thinking how the whole app would unfold.

Then I started building the components ...âŒ›
